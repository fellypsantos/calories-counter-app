        <SmallBoxContent title="Male" content="66.5 + (13.75 * weight) + (5.003 * height) - (6.76 * age)" />
        <SmallBoxContent title="Female" content="65.51 + (13.75 * weight) + (5.003 * height) - (6.775 * age)" />

        <MainTitle>How is basal metabolism related to calories?</MainTitle>
        <Subtitle renderAsParagraph>{'\t\t\t'}The relation between basal metabolism and calorie intake is pretty simple; the higher the basal metabolism/energy expenditure, the higher the number of calories you should consume. In order words, if you need to lose weight (or be able to eat more without gaining weight üçî), you need to increase your basal metabolism.</Subtitle>
